# Hydroelectric-plants

This repository presents a multi-criteria optimization strategy for model and filter selection applied to improve the management of hydroelectric power plants.

The strategy consideres the Optuna based on tree-structured Parzen estimator to select the predictor and the filter for the time series.

The standard recurrent neural network (RNN), dilated RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal fusion transformer (TFT), temporal convolutional neural, deep non-parametric time series forecaster, neural basis expansion analysis for time series forecasting, and neural hierarchical interpolation for time series forecasting models were considered.

The study considers the inflow data from the Belo Monte dam in Brazil.
The  models are considered. 

The Christiano Fitzgerald, Hodrick-Prescott, season-trend decomposition using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS), and multiple season-trend decomposition using LOESS filters are evaluated.
