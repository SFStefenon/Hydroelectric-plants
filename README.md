# Hydroelectric-plants

This repository presents a multi-criteria optimization strategy for model and filter selection applied to improve the management of hydroelectric power plants.
The strategy considers the Optuna based on a tree-structured Parzen estimator to select the predictor and the filter for the time series.

The standard recurrent neural network (RNN), dilated RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal fusion transformer (TFT), temporal convolutional neural (TCN), deep non-parametric time series forecaster (DeepNPTS), neural basis expansion analysis for time series forecasting (N-BEATS), and neural hierarchical interpolation for time series forecasting (NHITS) models were considered.

The Christiano Fitzgerald, Hodrick-Prescott, season-trend decomposition using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS), and multiple season-trend decomposition using LOESS filters are evaluated. The study considers the inflow data from the Belo Monte dam in Brazil.
